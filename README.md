## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshot.webp)

I’ve done something like this before, but it was just a simple CodePen example to test the logic I had in mind at the time. So yeah, this was nice to do and polish as much as I could.

### What I learned

I learned that I need to minimize verbosity and cut down the steps needed for a simple action. I also used animations this time to make the coin flip more enjoyable. Another thing I found out is that aria-live doesn’t announce the new face if it’s the same as the last one.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

## Features

I added some features that weren’t part of the original challenge:

- Flip the coin using Space or Enter
- A subtle glow effect on the result display each time it updates
- A more realistic coin flip animation
- The button gets disabled while the animation is running

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
